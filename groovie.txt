We should try to make a browser-based beatbox...
Except that we have an arranger view. This view is itself simply a grid.
We can start simple, and gradually expand a lot. We could allow sub-beat alignment of samples.
We want to allow selecting samples, for example between 8-12 samples per pattern.
Up to N patterns. Can start small/simple, gradually add more controls.

Might seem challenging but:
- This can be 100% serverless
- Claude/Grok can help us a lot
- Sub-beat alignment can be a very cool differentiating factor
- None of the online drum machines let you select samples, or arrange patterns!

Controls:
We need a tempo at the top, probably 120 by default
Slightly rounded squares
Different rainbow colors for each sample

Super simple UI:
https://blog.omgmog.net/beatmaker/
https://splice.com/sounds/beatmaker

Make it open source on GitHub!

Later on:
- Rotary button or slider for sample volume
- Rotary or slider for sample panning

IDEA: for the arranger, we can compress the bit patterns with RLE.
Many bits off, then some bits on.
One hex number can encode the number of bits on or off.
Otherwise, directly encode an index and a length using 4 chars.
Then we can encode 4 on times using 16 chars?
=> not that important initially

IDEA: Checkbox, I agree to share this as public domain
IDEA: you could have a long drop-down menu to select the samples
- Very easy to do
- Number the samples, 000, 001, 002, ...

NOTE: this app should work well on mobile, which is another big plus!

We have enough samples to get started
https://github.com/tidalcycles/sounds-tr808-fischer
=> also lots more usable CC0 samples on opengameart

TODO: copy over a select subset of the 808 samples
=> we've already downloaded them
=> start by broadly deleting the super short or bad sounding ones

People use the terms "song mode", and "pattern chains"

TODO: write code to generate pattern cells in step_seq div

TODO: look at model.js code from NoiseCraft
=> do we want to replicate this structure?

TODO: create a main.js script, load it in index.html

- Need to be able to listen to patterns without playing the song
=> later on we can have play/stop icons in the corner

[DONE] TODO: look at those other step sequencer UIs you liked

[DONE] TODO: separate out tempo and volume controls, put them at the top

[DONE] TODO: try to look for audio samples on github
=> those stargate samples are really nice!
  definitely enough to get us started!
=> clear out the shitter ones, or the ones that use too much space

[DONE] TODO: try to come up with name, create dir under projects
