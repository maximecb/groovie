We should try to make a browser-based beatbox...
Except that we have an arranger view. This view is itself simply a grid.
We can start simple, and gradually expand a lot. We could allow sub-beat alignment of samples.
We want to allow selecting samples, for example between 8-12 samples per pattern.
Up to N patterns. Can start small/simple, gradually add more controls.

Might seem challenging but:
- This can be 100% serverless
- Claude/Grok can help us a lot
- Sub-beat alignment can be a very cool differentiating factor
- None of the online drum machines let you select samples, or arrange patterns!

Controls:
We need a tempo at the top, probably 120 by default
Slightly rounded squares
Different rainbow colors for each sample

Super simple UI:

https://splice.com/sounds/beatmaker

Make it open source on GitHub!

Later on:
- Rotary button or slider for sample volume
- Rotary or slider for sample panning

IDEA: for the arranger, we can compress the bit patterns with RLE.
Many bits off, then some bits on.
One hex number can encode the number of bits on or off.
Otherwise, directly encode an index and a length using 4 chars.
Then we can encode 4 on times using 16 chars?
=> not that important initially

IDEA: Checkbox, I agree to share this as public domain
IDEA: you could have a long drop-down menu to select the samples
- Very easy to do
- Number the samples, 000, 001, 002, ...

NOTE: this app should work well on mobile, which is another big plus!

We have enough samples to get started
https://github.com/tidalcycles/sounds-tr808-fischer
=> also lots more usable CC0 samples on opengameart

TODO: copy over a select subset of the 808 samples
=> we've already downloaded them
=> start by broadly deleting the super short or bad sounding ones

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

People use the terms "song mode", and "pattern chains"

IDEA: you could prompt grok for code to draw just the grid
TODO: try to create html/js template with claude/grok
=> can ask for drop-down menu to select beats per bar
=> buttons to increase or decrease pattern length by one bar
=> try to iterate on the prompt
=> First focus on just drawing the grids and controls, not the audio rendering

TODO: create a style.css, make the background black

  definitely enough to get us started!
